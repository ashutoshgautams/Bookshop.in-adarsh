    <h3>Our story begins with you</h3>
    
    <h4>A student based bookstore!</h4>
    <p1>Bookshop is an intercommunity online 'student-to-student' bookstore that connects
        students to buy or sell used books by making it fast and easy for anyone to post
         a listing on the web. Sellers can easily earn some extra cash by simply posting 
        used books that are no longer in use for them - thus, giving buyers the opportunity
         to find great value books at affordable price deals. Bookshop is committed to creating
         a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to book exchanges. By giving used books a second
         life, we're reducing waste and promoting a more environmentally conscious student community.</p1>
         <br><br>
         <p2>"Selling used second hand books at your own desired price is not an uphill battle anymore.
             Just sell them on Bookshop!"</p2>
           <br>

    books but also about making a positive impact on the planet.</p3><br>
